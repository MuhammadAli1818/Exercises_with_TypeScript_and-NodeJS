// Q45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function car(manufacturer, model, ...rest) {
    let car = Object.assign({ manufacturer: manufacturer, model: model }, rest);
    console.log(car);
}
car("Toyota", "Camry", "color", "black");

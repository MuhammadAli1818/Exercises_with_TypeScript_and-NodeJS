// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
// define the array for favorite fruits
let favorite_fruits = ["Mango", "Banana", "Orange"];
// Check if mango is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Mango")) {
    console.log("I really like mango!");
}
// check if banana is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Banana")) {
    console.log("I really like banana!");
}
// check if orange is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Orange")) {
    console.log("I really like orange!");
}
// check if apple is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Apple")) {
    console.log("I really like apple!");
}
// check if kiwi is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Kiwi")) {
    console.log("I really like kiwi!");
